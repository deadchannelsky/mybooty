- [ ] Implement simple ship rocking motion (sin wave rotation)
- [ ] Add basic ocean background (simple blue gradient)
- [ ] Position ship deck select from decks sprites appropriately in scene
- [ ] Test rocking motion doesn't interfere with physics

## Loot System
- [ ] Create base Loot class/script for all items
- [ ] Implement  basic loot types for all loot sprites in ./art/lootsprites:
  - [ ] Barrel (medium size, stable)
  - [ ] Cannonball (small, heavy, rolls)
  - [ ] Treasure Chest (large, rectangular)
  - [ ] Bottle (tall, narrow, tips easily)
  - [ ] Sword (long, awkward shape)
  - [ ] Hook
  - [ ] Bottle
  - [ ] Fish
  - [x] Cup
  - [x] Skull  
  - [x] Idol
  - [x] Crown
  - [x] Hat
  - [x] Spyglass
  - [x] Pegleg
  - [x] Map

- [ ] Create loot spawner system (random selection)
- [ ] Add basic sprites/placeholder art for each loot type

## Input System
- [ ] Implement tap-to-drop mechanic
- [ ] Create loot preview system (shows next item to drop)
- [ ] Add drop position control (tap location affects drop point)
- [ ] Test input responsiveness on mobile

## Scoring System
- [ ] Create score manager script
- [ ] Award points for each successfully placed loot item
- [ ] Display current score in UI
- [ ] Track and display high score
- [ ] Save/load high score data

## Game Over Detection
- [ ] Detect when loot falls off ship deck
- [ ] Implement ship tipping threshold (angle limit)
- [ ] Create game over state management
- [ ] Show game over screen with final score
- [ ] Add restart functionality

## Basic UI
- [ ] Create main menu scene (Play button, title)
- [ ] Design game UI (score display, pause option)
- [ ] Implement game over screen (score, restart, menu)
- [ ] Add basic navigation between screens
- [ ] Style UI with pirate theme (wooden buttons, etc.)

## Testing & Polish
- [ ] Test core game loop (play â†’ game over â†’ restart)
- [ ] Balance loot physics properties
- [ ] Adjust ship rocking speed/amplitude
- [ ] Fine-tune scoring values
- [ ] Test on mobile device if possible
- [ ] Fix any critical bugs or crashes

## Documentation
- [ ] Comment all code for clarity
- [ ] Update this todo list with completion status
- [ ] Document any design decisions or changes
- [ ] Prepare notes for Phase 2 planning

## Success Criteria for Phase 1 Completion:
âœ… Player can start game from main menu  
âœ… Loot drops and stacks realistically on ship deck  
âœ… Ship rocks gently without breaking physics  
âœ… Game ends when stack falls or ship tips too far  
âœ… Score is tracked and displayed  
âœ… Player can restart immediately after game over  
âœ… All 5 loot types have unique physics properties  
âœ… Game is stable and playable for 2+ minutes

# Android Build Environment Setup - Completed

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
- [x] Installed OpenJDK 17 via Homebrew
- [x] Set up JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables  
- [x] Verified Java 17 installation

### 2. Install Android Studio with SDK and tools
- [x] Installed Android Studio via Homebrew
- [x] Set up ANDROID_HOME environment variables

### 3. Generate Debug Keystore
- [x] Created debug keystore at `~/.android/debug.keystore`
- [x] Configured with standard Android debug credentials

### 4. Configure Export Settings
- [x] Updated export_presets.cfg with proper package name
- [x] Enabled custom build (use_gradle_build=true)
- [x] Added debug keystore configuration
- [x] Set version name and package details

## ðŸ“‹ Manual Steps Required

### Install Android Build Template in Godot
**You need to complete this step manually:**
1. Open your project in Godot
2. Go to `Project` â†’ `Install Android Build Template...`
3. Click "Manage Templates..."
4. Click "Download" for your current Godot version
5. Click "Install" in the confirmation dialog

### Complete Android SDK Setup
1. Launch Android Studio first time to complete SDK installation
2. Accept all SDK licenses
3. Install recommended SDK components

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Testing

Once you complete the manual steps above, you can:

1. Open your project in Godot
2. Go to `Project` â†’ `Export...`
3. Select the "Android" preset
4. Click "Export Project"
5. Choose a filename ending in .apk
6. Click "Save" to build the APK

## ðŸ”§ Environment Configuration Summary

- **Java**: OpenJDK 17 installed and configured
- **Android Studio**: Installed with SDK tools
- **Debug Keystore**: Created at `~/.android/debug.keystore`
- **Package Name**: `com.campfirenerds.mybooty`
- **Architecture**: ARM64 (arm64-v8a) - suitable for modern Android devices
- **Signing**: Configured for debug builds

## Review

Successfully prepared the development environment for Android builds:
- Installed all required development tools (Java 17, Android Studio)
- Generated debug keystore for app signing  
- Configured Godot export settings with proper package information
- Set up environment variables for SDK access

The setup follows Godot's official requirements and uses industry-standard tools. Manual completion of Android Build Template installation in Godot will enable APK export functionality.

## Notes:
- Focus on making the core loop fun before adding complexity
- Keep art simple/placeholder for Phase 1 - gameplay first
- Test frequently on actual mobile device
- Each loot type should feel different when dropped
- Ship rocking should add challenge but not frustration
